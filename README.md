# Fair Image Generation of Minority Groups

The project aims to answer the question :
> Can the use of SCM model for disentangling the minority groups in the latent variable be used in a bidirectional generative model to create new images of the minority group for the training of supervised image classification model ?

Specifically in this project the bias is introduced in the dataset which entails:
> Women are more likely to smile compared to males.
